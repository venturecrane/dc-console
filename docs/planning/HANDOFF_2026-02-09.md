# Session Handoff - 2026-02-09

**Status:** Done
**Session:** sess_01KH1PD4VRHFAXW6KV17EDWNW1
**Venture:** Draft Crane (dc)

## Summary

Analyzed P0 issue dependencies and codebase structure to determine parallelization capacity.

**Key finding:** Maximum 2-3 reliable parallel streams due to editor (#21) being the bottleneck - most features depend on it.

---

## Created This Session

- `docs/planning/PARALLELIZATION_PLAN.md` - **READ THIS FIRST**

---

## Recommended Parallel Streams

| Stream         | Issues                      | File Domain                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Backend API    | #19 Projects → #20 Chapters | `routes/`, `services/`       |
| Editor UI      | #21 with mock data          | `web/src/components/editor/` |
| Infrastructure | AI client + Export worker   | `services/ai-client.ts`      |

---

## Next Steps

1. **READ** `docs/planning/PARALLELIZATION_PLAN.md` before starting work
2. Define shared type contracts (Phase 0) to unlock parallel streams
3. Begin #19 (Projects API) - it unblocks everything else

## Codebase State

- D1 schema: 6 tables migrated
- Cloudflare bindings: D1, R2, KV configured
- API: Only health endpoint implemented
- Frontend: Bare Next.js template
- Ready for feature development
