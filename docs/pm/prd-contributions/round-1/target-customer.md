## 1. My Current Pain Points

Here is what my writing workflow actually looks like today, and I am not proud of it.

I have roughly 200 pages of notes scattered across maybe 40 Google Docs. Some are titled things like "Chapter 3 draft maybe" and some are titled "Notes from Delta engagement Q3." There is no system. I open Google Drive, I search for something I know I wrote, and half the time I cannot find it. The other half, I find three versions of it and do not know which one is current.

I have tried to outline this book three times. The first time I did it in Google Docs as a bulleted list. The second time a colleague recommended Notion, and I spent an entire Saturday afternoon setting up databases and templates before realizing I had done zero actual writing. The third time I tried Scrivener because a friend who writes novels swears by it. I downloaded it on my MacBook, spent 45 minutes staring at the interface, and closed it. I do not need a corkboard. I need someone to help me figure out which of my 200 pages of notes belong in Chapter 1 versus Chapter 7 versus the trash.

I have also tried using ChatGPT. Multiple times. Here is the pattern: I paste in a section of my notes and say "turn this into a book chapter." It gives me something that reads like a textbook written by a committee. It strips out everything that makes my frameworks mine. My clients hire me because I explain things in a way that clicks. ChatGPT explains things in a way that sounds like every other business book on the shelf. I have tried giving it style instructions, tone instructions, examples of my voice. It gets closer, but it still feels like someone else wearing my clothes.

The other thing that happens is I write in bursts. I will have an inspired 90 minutes on a Sunday morning and produce five really strong pages. Then I do not touch it for three weeks because I have client work. When I come back, I cannot remember where I left off, what I was trying to argue, or which document has the latest version. So I start re-reading everything, lose my momentum, and close the laptop.

I also work on my iPad about 80% of the time. I am in airports, I am at client sites, I am on my couch. My MacBook lives on my desk at home. Most of the "serious" writing tools seem designed for someone sitting at a desk with a big screen. I do not have that lifestyle. If I cannot write on my iPad in a hotel room, I am not writing.

The net result: I have been "writing a book" for three years. I have 200 pages of raw material that could probably produce a strong 250-page book. I have zero finished chapters. Every time I talk to a colleague, they tell me my frameworks are brilliant and I need to publish. I agree with them. And then I open Google Drive and feel overwhelmed and close it.

## 2. First Reactions to DraftCrane

### What excites me

The tagline "Your book. Your files. Your cloud" is the first thing from a writing tool that has made me feel like someone understands my actual concern. I do not want to upload my intellectual property to some startup's server and pray they do not go out of business or get acquired. My book is literally my career distilled into words. The fact that my files stay in my Google Drive is huge. That alone would get me to try this.

The "Book Blueprint" concept is interesting. A living document that captures my voice, my terminology, my key claims. If the AI actually uses that to stay consistent, that addresses my number one complaint about ChatGPT. I have a very specific way I talk about organizational transformation. I call certain things by certain names. I have signature phrases my clients know me by. If this tool can learn that and not flatten it into generic business-speak, that would be genuinely valuable.

The chapter-based structure with sidebar navigation is exactly what I need instead of 40 separate Google Docs. Just knowing where everything lives would save me hours of "where did I put that" searching.

The Idea Inbox with voice dictation is exciting because I have ideas constantly. In cabs, in the shower, walking between meetings. Right now I put them in Apple Notes and they die there. If I could speak an idea and have it automatically suggested for a place in my book, that would be wonderful.

### What confuses me

The PRD mentions "OAuth" multiple times. I do not know what that is. I assume it is the thing where you click "Sign in with Google" and a popup appears? If so, just call it that. If it is something else, I have no idea.

"Cloudflare Worker," "D1," "R2," "Hono" -- none of these words mean anything to me. I understand this document is partly for the people building the product, not for me. But the fact that there is an entire architecture section in what is supposed to be a product requirements document makes me wonder: Is this product being built for me, or for the engineers building it? I do not care where the data is cached. I care that when I open the app on my iPad at 6am, my chapter is there and it has not lost my last paragraph.

"Source Intelligence" -- what does this mean in practice? The description says "search imported source materials" and "suggest relevant sources." Does that mean it reads my Google Docs and pulls quotes from them? That would be amazing if so. But "Source Intelligence" sounds like a CIA briefing tool, not a writing feature.

"Craft Buttons" -- this name does not bother me, but I want to understand something. When I hit "Match Book Blueprint voice," what actually happens? Does it rewrite my paragraph? Does it highlight words that are off-brand? Does it suggest alternatives? The description says "one-tap transformations" which makes it sound like it just changes my text. I would want to see what it plans to do before it does it.

### What scares me

**Losing my work.** I know it says files are stored in my Drive. But what happens between the moment I type a sentence and the moment it saves to Drive? If my iPad loses Wi-Fi in a hotel (which happens constantly), do I lose what I typed? "Auto-save" is mentioned but I want to understand the failure modes. I have lost work before. It is an awful feeling.

**The AI replacing my voice.** I mentioned this already, but it is my primary fear. If I hit "Expand" and it turns my concise, punchy paragraph into three paragraphs of filler, that is worse than useless. I would need to see a before/after preview. I would need to be able to undo instantly. And I would need the AI to get better at sounding like me over time, not just apply generic "business writing" patterns.

**Cost and lock-in.** The PRD says no lock-in because files are in Google Drive. Fine. But what about my Book Blueprint? What about my chapter organization? What about my inline notes and comments? If I cancel DraftCrane, do I just have a bunch of Google Docs with no structure? That is basically where I am now. "No lock-in" needs to mean that my organized book structure survives, not just my raw text.

**This being a startup that disappears.** I do not know who is building this. The document mentions "Venture Crane portfolio product" and "kill criteria." I understand that is honest, but reading that the product will be killed if certain metrics are not met makes me nervous about investing my time in it. If I spend 60 hours organizing my book in DraftCrane and then it gets "killed," what happens to me?

### What is missing

**Onboarding for my existing mess.** I have 200 pages of notes across 40 documents. The PRD describes a clean user journey: create a project, connect cloud storage, receive an outline. But what about the phase where the AI helps me sort through my existing chaos? I do not need a blank project. I need a tool that looks at my 40 documents and says "I think these 8 are about leadership transitions, these 12 are about culture frameworks, and these 6 are duplicates." That is what would genuinely change my life.

**Progress tracking.** How far along am I? Am I 30% done? 60%? How many words do I have? How many do I need? Is Chapter 4 a skeleton and Chapter 2 basically done? I want a dashboard that tells me where I am in the journey. The PRD mentions "Chapter health indicators" in Phase 2, but that feels essential from day one.

**A way to work with my editor.** I will eventually hire a developmental editor. That person will need to read my manuscript, leave comments, and suggest structural changes. The PRD puts collaboration in Phase 2. I understand phasing, but even a "share a read-only link" feature in Phase 0 would help. Otherwise I am exporting PDFs and emailing them back and forth, which is what I do now.

**Offline mode.** I write on planes. I write in hotels with bad Wi-Fi. If this only works with a strong internet connection, I will hit walls. This is not mentioned anywhere in the PRD.

## 3. Phase 0 Feature Priority

Here is how I would rank the Phase 0 features, from most to least important to me personally:

### 1. Google Drive Integration (Most Important)

This is the entire reason I would try DraftCrane instead of just using Google Docs. If the connection is seamless, if I can point it at my existing folder of notes and it pulls them in, if my writing saves back to my Drive so I know it is safe -- this is the foundation. Without this, DraftCrane is just another editor, and I do not need another editor. I need an editor that understands my files are already somewhere and works with them rather than asking me to start over.

What would make me say yes: If I can connect my Drive, select my "Book Project" folder, and within 5 minutes see my existing documents organized in a way that makes sense. If it auto-saves reliably. If I can verify my files are in Drive by opening Drive in another tab.

### 2. Basic Editor

This needs to be genuinely good on iPad. Not "works on iPad" but "feels like it was designed for iPad." Touch targets need to be right. Scrolling needs to be smooth. I should be able to select text with my finger or Apple Pencil without fighting the interface. The chapter sidebar needs to work without covering my text. Auto-save needs to be visible (a small "saved" indicator so I feel safe).

What would make me say yes: If it feels as natural as Google Docs but with actual book structure. If I can see my chapters, tap between them, and always know where I am.

### 3. AI Rewrite

This is the differentiator, but also the riskiest feature. If the AI rewrites are generic and strip my voice, I will leave and never come back. If they are genuinely good -- if they take my rough notes and polish them while keeping my style -- this is worth paying for. In Phase 0 without the Book Blueprint, I am worried the AI will not have enough context about my voice. But even basic "expand this" and "simplify this" would be useful if done well.

What would make me say yes: If the first AI rewrite I try makes me think "yes, that sounds like a better version of me" instead of "that sounds like ChatGPT."

### 4. PDF/EPUB Export

This matters, but not in my first session. I am not going to export anything on day one. I care about this because it means I can see what my book will actually look like, and I can share drafts with colleagues. But honestly, for the first few weeks I just need to write. Export can be basic as long as it works.

What would make me say yes: If the PDF looks professional without me doing any formatting. If it is literally one click and I get something I could show to a publisher without embarrassment.

### 5. Auth System (Least Important to Me, But I Understand It is Necessary)

I do not think about authentication. I sign in with Google, I expect it to work. This is table stakes, not a feature. If you asked me to create a separate username and password for DraftCrane, I would be mildly annoyed but I would do it. If you let me sign in with Google, I would not even think about it. Do not make this complicated.

What would make me say yes: If I literally never have to think about this after the first time.

---

## 4. The First Session Test

### How I heard about DraftCrane

Probably a LinkedIn post from someone in my network. Maybe a consultant I respect posted "I finally finished my book, and this tool made the difference." Or maybe I saw a targeted ad that said something like "You have 200 pages of notes and no finished book. We can fix that." That would stop my scroll. Alternatively, someone mentioned it in a Slack community for consultants who are writing books. Word of mouth from a peer would be the strongest signal.

### The first 5 minutes

I land on the website. I want to understand in 30 seconds: What does this do, who is it for, and how is it different from Google Docs plus ChatGPT? If the landing page talks about "Cloudflare Workers" or "AI orchestration," I am gone. If it shows me a before (scattered notes) and after (organized book manuscript), I am interested.

I click "Try it" or "Start your book." I sign in with Google. It asks to connect to my Google Drive. I say yes. It asks me to select a folder. I navigate to my "Book Project" folder. It scans my documents.

Now here is the critical moment: What happens next? If it shows me a blank project with an empty outline, I feel deflated. I just connected 40 documents and nothing happened. If it says something like "I found 38 documents with approximately 47,000 words. Let me help you organize these into chapters" -- now I am leaning forward.

### What would make me keep going versus close the tab

**Keep going:** The tool demonstrates that it understands my content. It groups my documents by theme. It suggests a possible chapter structure. It lets me drag things around and reorganize. I start to feel like my mess has a shape.

**Close the tab:** Blank page. A template that asks me to fill in "Book Title" and "Target Audience" before I can do anything. Too many options. A tutorial video I have to watch. Anything that feels like setup rather than progress.

### What "complete a chapter" means to me

This is an important question because I think the PRD team and I might define this differently. A "complete chapter" to me is probably 3,000 to 5,000 words that flow logically, make a clear argument, include at least one case study or example, and read well enough that I would let a colleague see it. It does not need to be final-draft polished. It needs to be solid-draft complete.

In a first session? That is aggressive. If I am starting from scratch, that is not happening. But if I can pull in 15 pages of existing notes that are roughly about the same topic and restructure them into a coherent chapter with some AI assistance? Maybe. That is actually a realistic scenario for me because I have the raw material. I do not need to generate content from nothing. I need to organize and polish content I already have.

I think a realistic first session for me would be 90 minutes to 2 hours. In that time, I would want to: connect my Drive, see my documents organized, pick one chapter to focus on, pull in the relevant notes, restructure them with AI help, and end up with a rough but recognizable chapter. If I can do that, I would feel like I made more progress in 2 hours than I have in 3 years.

### What would bring me back for a second session

The feeling that my book is now a real project, not a pipe dream. Specifically: if I close DraftCrane and open it the next day and everything is exactly where I left it. My chapters are organized. My progress is visible. The next step is obvious. I do not have to remember what I was doing. The tool remembers for me.

Also, a small psychological trick: if Session 1 ends with the tool saying "You have 1 chapter in solid draft and 11 to go. Based on your pace, you could have a complete first draft in 8 weeks" -- that would motivate me. I have never had a timeline for this book. Seeing one would make it feel achievable.

---

## 5. Willingness to Pay

### What I would pay

Let me put this in context. I bill clients $400/hour. My time is extremely valuable. If DraftCrane saves me even 10 hours over the course of writing this book versus my current chaotic process, it is worth $4,000 to me in opportunity cost. But psychologically, that is not how software purchasing works.

**Monthly subscription:** I would comfortably pay $29/month without thinking about it. That is less than my Spotify and New York Times subscriptions combined. At $49/month, I would want to feel like I am getting significant value every month. At $79/month or above, I would need to believe this is genuinely replacing a service I would otherwise pay thousands for (like a book coach or developmental editor).

**Annual plan:** $199/year would be a no-brainer if the tool is good. $349/year would be reasonable for a serious writing tool. Above $500/year, I would hesitate.

**One-time purchase:** I would pay $199 to $299 one-time if the tool were mature and I trusted it would not disappear. But for a startup product, one-time does not make sense for either side. I understand subscriptions.

### What justifies payment versus what should be free

**Should be free (or part of a free tier):** Basic editor, connecting to Google Drive, organizing chapters, basic export. This is the "try it" layer. If you make me pay before I know whether this works for me, I will never find out.

**Justifies payment:** AI rewriting that actually sounds like me. The Book Blueprint / voice matching. Source Intelligence that pulls from my notes. Professional export formatting. The Idea Inbox. Basically, anything that involves AI processing or saves me significant time.

**Premium tier territory:** Collaboration features. Advanced export options. The consistency engine. Developmental editing AI. These feel like professional-tier features.

### Competitive products I have paid for or considered

- **Scrivener:** $49, purchased, used for approximately 2 hours, abandoned. Too complicated.
- **Notion:** Free tier, used for about a month for book planning, abandoned. Great for project management, not for long-form writing.
- **ChatGPT Plus:** $20/month, I pay for this. Use it for client work and have tried it for book writing. The output does not sound like me.
- **Grammarly Premium:** $12/month, I pay for this. Useful for polishing but not for writing.
- **Otter.ai:** $10/month, I have considered it for transcribing voice ideas. Have not subscribed.
- **Book coach:** $150-300/hour, I have considered this. Have not committed because I feel like I should "have more done" before hiring someone.

### No-brainer versus have-to-think-about-it

**No-brainer:** $19-29/month. I would not even check the receipt.

**Have to think about it:** $49-79/month. I would want to see clear value after a free trial.

**Would not pay:** Over $99/month. At that point I would hire a human book coach for a few sessions instead.

## 6. Red Flags

Here is what in the PRD would make me hesitate, walk away, or actively distrust this product:

**The architecture section.** Section 10 of the PRD lists things like "Cloudflare Worker," "D1," "R2," and "GitHub." I understand this is a technical document and the engineers need this information. But the fact that it is in the PRD at all signals to me that this product is being thought about from the engineering side out, not the user side in. When I read a product document, I want to understand what my experience will be. I do not want to know what database my words are stored in. If this technical thinking bleeds into the actual product interface in any way -- if I ever see the word "Worker" or "D1" or "OAuth" on my screen while I am writing -- I will feel like this tool was not built for me.

**The kill criteria.** I appreciate the honesty. I do. But telling me upfront that this product might be killed in 90 days is not confidence-inspiring. Every other product I use pretends it will exist forever, even if it will not. I am not saying lie to me. I am saying: do not put this in front of customers. Keep it internal. Because when I read "no user completes a full chapter in their first session" as a kill metric, I think: "Great, so if I have a bad first day, I am contributing to this product's death? No pressure."

**"AI as partner, not replacement" is the right principle but the execution details are thin.** The PRD says every AI action requires user approval and there are no silent rewrites. Good. But how? Does it show me a diff? A side-by-side comparison? A popup? The difference between "annoying popup on every action" and "elegant inline suggestion" is the difference between a tool I love and a tool I abandon. The principle is right but I have no confidence in the execution from what I have read.

**Phase 0 without the Book Blueprint feels incomplete.** The PRD says the Book Blueprint (voice and tone rules, terminology, key claims) is Phase 1, not Phase 0. But the Book Blueprint is what would make the AI useful to me specifically. Without it, the AI rewrite in Phase 0 is just... ChatGPT in a different window. What makes DraftCrane different from pasting my text into ChatGPT and saying "rewrite this"? The Blueprint is the answer to that question. Putting it in Phase 1 means Phase 0's AI is generic, which means my first experience with DraftCrane's AI will be unimpressive, which means I might not stick around for Phase 1.

**No mention of mobile responsiveness specifics.** The PRD says "fully functional in iPad browsers" and "Safari on iPad is the primary test target." Good. But there is no mention of the specific challenges of iPad writing: the on-screen keyboard taking up half the screen, the lack of hover states, the way Safari handles web apps differently than Chrome, the split-screen multitasking I might want to use. "Works on iPad" and "delightful on iPad" are very different things. I have used too many "mobile-responsive" web apps that technically work on iPad but are miserable to actually use.

**The success metric "time to first draft chapter < 2 hours" feels arbitrary.** Two hours to produce a draft chapter is fast if you are writing from scratch. It is slow if you are reorganizing existing notes. My use case is the latter. A better metric might be: "time from connecting existing materials to having a recognizable chapter structure." For someone like me, the value is not in generating new text. The value is in organizing existing text. The PRD does not seem to distinguish between these two user types, and I suspect there are a lot of people like me -- people who have the content but not the structure.

**No mention of version history or undo.** The PRD mentions "version snapshots" in Phase 2 as a collaboration feature. But version history is a safety feature that I need from day one. If the AI rewrites a paragraph and I do not like it, can I go back? If I reorganize my chapters and it was a mistake, can I undo it? Google Docs has version history and I use it constantly. If DraftCrane does not have this in Phase 0, I will feel unsafe making changes, which means I will not use the AI features, which means the core value proposition collapses.

**The name "DraftCrane."** I am going to be honest. I do not understand what a crane has to do with writing a book. "Draft" makes sense. "Crane" does not. Is it lifting something? Is it a bird? When I tell my colleagues about this tool, will I have to explain the name? A writing tool for professionals should have a name that sounds professional. This is minor, but it is real. I would feel a little silly saying "I'm writing my book in DraftCrane."

---

## Summary

I am exactly the person this product is being built for. I have the content, the expertise, the desire to publish, and the budget to pay for a good tool. What I lack is a system that respects my existing workflow (iPad, Google Drive, scattered notes), protects my voice, and makes the book feel achievable rather than overwhelming.

DraftCrane has the right instincts. The ownership model is correct. The AI-as-partner principle is correct. The iPad-first approach is correct. But the Phase 0 scope worries me because it ships the generic pieces (editor, basic AI) without the differentiating pieces (Book Blueprint, source organization). My first experience with DraftCrane will feel like "a slightly nicer Google Doc with ChatGPT bolted on" rather than "the tool that finally helps me finish my book."

The single most important thing DraftCrane could do in Phase 0 is help me make sense of my existing 200 pages of notes. Not ask me to start writing from scratch in a new tool. Help me bring order to the chaos I already have. If it does that, I am a customer for life. If it gives me another blank page, I already have forty of those.
