# /eod - End of Day Handoff

Update handoff file at session end with work accomplished and guidance for next session.

## Usage

```
/eod
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Detect Repository

```bash
# Get repo from git remote
REPO=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's/.*github\.com[:\/]([^\/]+\/[^\/]+)(\.git)?$/\1/')
REPO_NAME=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d'/' -f2)

echo "## 🌙 End of Day: $REPO_NAME"
echo ""
```

### 2. Prompt for Session Summary

Ask the user to provide:

```
Please provide a brief summary of this session:

1. **What was accomplished?**
   (Issues worked on, PRs created/merged, problems solved)

2. **What's in progress?**
   (Unfinished work, where you left off)

3. **What's blocked or needs attention?**
   (Blockers, questions for PM, decisions needed)

4. **Recommended next steps?**
   (What the next session should focus on)
```

### 3. Read Current Handoff File

```bash
HANDOFF_FILE="docs/handoffs/DEV.md"

if [ -f "$HANDOFF_FILE" ]; then
  CURRENT_CONTENT=$(cat "$HANDOFF_FILE")
else
  CURRENT_CONTENT=""
fi
```

### 4. Generate Updated Handoff

Create/update the handoff file with structure:

```markdown
# Dev Team Handoff

**Last Updated:** [TODAY'S DATE]

  git push
  echo "✅ Handoff committed and pushed"

if [ -n "$SESSION_FILES" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "### Session Files"
  echo ""
  echo "Found session tracking files:"
  for f in $SESSION_FILES; do
    echo "- $f"
  done
  echo ""
  echo "Options:"
  echo "1. Delete (work complete)"

## Handoff File Location

| Repository Type                 | Handoff Path           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Product repo (dfg, sc-\*)       | `docs/handoffs/DEV.md` |
| Infrastructure repo (crane-\*)  | `docs/handoffs/DEV.md` |
| Operations repo (\*-operations) | `DEV.md` (root)        |

## Notes

- Prompts for structured input rather than free-form
- Preserves previous handoff history (appends, doesn't overwrite)
- Optionally commits and pushes changes
- Handles session file cleanup
- Works with any repository in the Venture Crane ecosystem
- The handoff file becomes the input for next session's `/sod`
